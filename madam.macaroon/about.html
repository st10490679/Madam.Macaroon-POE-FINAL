                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded with a passion for baking, Madam Macaroon blends traditional French recipes
                    with a modern twist. Our goal is to create pastries that not only satisfy your sweet tooth
                    but also bring a little bit of joy to your everyday moments. We believe baking is more
                    than food—it's an experience. Bringing Paris to Johannesburg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From our small kitchen to your table, each treat is crafted by hand, ensuring
                    freshness, flavour, and elegance in every bite. Whether it’s macarons, éclairs,
                    or seasonal pastries, we aim to make each moment special.
